      	<h3>
      		So, what is it exactly?
  		</h3>
        <p>
          Responsive Web Design is the practice of designing and building web sites and applications that <em>respond</em> to users' devices: responsive interfaces 
          will adapt themselves to the user's device in a way that enables the user to transparently use that application regardless of factors like device or browser type or screen resolution.
        </p>

        <p>
        	When coupled with the techniques of <strong>progressive enhancement</strong>, we can essentially build a user interface that adapts itself to a near-comprehensive set of devices and 
        	browsers, allowing users on any platform to engage in a meaningful experience with our applications. 
    	</p>
      </article>

      <article>
      	<h2>But there's alternatives to this, right?</h2>
      	
      	<p class="source">
      		Yep.
  		</p>
  	  </article>

  	  <article>
  	  	<h3>Alternative: Doing Absolutely Nothing<h3>

  	  	<ul class="build">
  	  		<li>
  	  			Pros:
  	  			<ol>
  	  				<li>It costs us absolutely no time and effort</li>
  	  				<li>The site generally works "well enough" on a sampling of devices&hellip;</li>
	  		    </ol>
  		    </li>
  		    <li>
  		    	Cons:
  	  			<ol>
  	  				<li>"Well enough" isn't good enough</li>
	  		    </ol>
  		    </li>  		    	
	    </ul>
	  </article>

  	  <article>
  	  	<h3>Alternative: Building Native Applications<h3>

  	  	<ul class="build">
  	  		<li>
  	  			Pros:
  	  			<ol>
  	  				<li>We're building a truly native application, so we have access to a wide-range of device-specific APIs for extra functionality (cameras!)</li>
  	  				<li>A native application is guaranteed to look and work just fine on the device it's built for</li>
	  		    </ol>
  		    </li>
  		    <li>
  		    	Cons:
  	  			<ol>
  	  				<li>We're in the mobile application business: now we're writing Objective-C or Java and building for a variety of new platforms</li>
  	  				<li>We've got a bunch of new applications to develop, test, and maintain</li>
  	  				<li>We have to live by App Store policies: Instead of pushing a fix on our own time, we're beholden to the dreaded App Store approval process</li>
	  		    </ol>
  		    </li>  		    	
	    </ul>

  	  	<h3>Alternative: Serving Different Content to Different User Agents<h3>

	    <p class="smaller">
	    	.NET MVC 4.0 introduces user agent sniffing by convention and design, which would allow us to change the content we serve up to different user agents and show an iPhone- or Android-specific view instead of our default view.
	    </p>  	  			

  	  	<ul class="build smaller">
  	  		<li>
  	  			Pros:
  	  			<ol>
  	  				<li>It's targeted: we can build a very specific experience for a specific browser</li>
  	  				<li>We're saving bandwidth: we can tailor views to mobile, saving mobile users from receiving huge amounts of markup or images</li>
  	  				<li>We have potential access to device APIs via serving up views specific to those devices</li>
	  		    </ol>
  		    </li>
  		    <li>
  		    	Cons:
  	  			<ol>
  	  				<li>Is this scalable? We'll end up with views for iPhone, iPad, Android, &infin;</li>
  	  				<li>How do we handle cross-platform differences within the same device?</li>
  	  				<li>Will we always be bogged down by building for the lowest common denominator device on each platform? Is iOS 4 going to be the new IE6, or do we 
  	  					just drop support for it?</li>
	  		    </ol>
  		    </li>  		    	
	    </ul>
	  </article>	 

  	  <article>
  	  	<h3>And Responsive Web Design's the Answer?<h3>

  	  	<p>
  	  		It can be: It gives us the best combination of effort and impact across devices, plus it requires <em>very little</em> change to our codebase and it allows 
  	  		us to basically forget about designing and building for devices and instead allows us to design and build for user experience. 
	  	</p>

	  	<p class="delay">
	  		I, for one, don't want to start debugging differences in iOS 5, iOS 5.1, Android Gingerbread and Android Ice Cream Sandwich alongside IE7, IE9 and Google Chrome.
  		</p>
	  </article>		     

  	  <article>
  	  	<h2> So, how do we make our application responsive?</h2>
	  </article>		 

	  <article>
	  	<h3>
	  		Fist, we define <em>baseline</em> functionality for each section of the site.
	  	</h3>
	  	<p>
	  		Baseline functionality is just that: it's the level of functionality that we want every user of the site to see, regardless of what device or browser they're using.
	  		It's our site's design and functionality stripped down to the barebones experience: users receive just enough content, styling, and interactivity to accomplish their goal. That's it.
  		</p>
	  </article>    

	  <article>
	  	<h3>
	  		This is a <em>conversation</em> that leads us into a build process
	  	</h3>
	  	<p>
	  		We're talking to people like stakeholders and product folks to come to an agreement on one basic question: what's the primary goal for a user to accomplish this goal and 
	  		what's the minimum level of functionality we need in place to achieve it?
  		</p>
	  </article>    		  	  

	  <article>
	  	<h3>
	  		After that, we build a stripped down version of our site
	  	</h3>
	  	<p>
	  		It could be as simple as this:  		
  		</p>
  		<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
/* Baseline discussion - hide elements that we don't need and set up some nice, default styles */
#contentLeftOuter, .simple-search-container, #breadcrumbs, #tags-panel, .ActionIcons, .iconColumn > ul{
    display: none;
}

.page-container {
/* We'll be setting the device-width via a meta tag, 
   so this gives us a nice fullscreen view on a mobile device */
    width: 100%;    
}

#contentRightOuter {
    width: 100%;
}
&lt;/style&gt;
		</pre>
	  </article>   

	  <article class="nobackground">
	  	<h3>That looks something like this:</h3>
	  	<iframe src="http://localhost/cafegourmet/DiscussionContribution/Index?GC=true&id=d0288058-fe1a-467f-9e85-47f46e4b794a&parentId=d0288058-fe1a-467f-9e85-47f46e4b794a&CcS=000" style="width:480px;"></iframe>

	  	<h2>
	  		In building a baseline, we've essentially covered a huge amount of devices and browsers. They're done.
  		</h2>
	  </article>    	  	  

	  <article>
	  	<h3>Now we build upon the baseline...</h3>
	  	<p>
	  		Using <em>media queries</em>, we can change how elements are styled based on the resolution we have available to us.

	  </article> 

	  <article>
	  	<p>
	  		Using our previous example, we might want to show the search bar if there's enough real estate available. 		
  		</p>
  		<p>
  			If the user's on an iPad in portrait mode or thereabouts, there's plenty of space for our search bar, so we can begin showing it:
	    </p>
  		<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
@media screen and (min-width: 640px){
    .site-nav-container .simple-search-container{
        display:block;
        width: 180px;
    }
    
    .site-nav-container .simple-search-textbox-item {
        width: 30%;
    }
} 
&lt;/style&gt;
		</pre>
	  </article>

	  <article class="nobackground">
	  	<h3>It's not just CSS Media Queries</h3>
	  	<p>
	  		Javascript Feature Detection allows us to take the enhancement further, creating a baseline level of browser support that must be in place before taxing 
	  		a browser with added javascript.
	  	</p>	  	   	
	  </article>	

	  <article class="nobackground">
	  	<h3>For example...</h3>
	  	<p>
	  		Older or underpowered browsers don't have access to the <code>document.querySelectorAll</code> API. What if we save them processing power by only loading certain

	  	<h3>How do we manage bandwidth?</h3>

	  	<div class="delay">
		  	<p>
		  		We don't want to sock mobile devices with a full download of everything, so how do we limit what we serve?
		  	</p>	  	   	

		  	Through a combination of:
		  	<ul>
		  		<li>Conditionally loaded scripts and stylesheets</li>
		  		<li>Responsive image loading</li>
		  		<li>And mobile-specific templates where we need them</li>
	  		</ul>
  		</div>

	  </article>	

	  <article>
	  	<h2>We covered the other two, but <em>responsive images</em>?</h2>
	  </article>	      

	  <article>
	  	<h3>Responsive Images</h3>
	  	<p>
	  		Currently a W3C proposal, responsive images would essentially allow you to specify which version of an image to serve for a certain screen resolution, 
	  		allowing you to only serve the largest size necessary for a device, saving bandwidth along the way.
  		</p>
  		<p>
  			While the standard develops, there are working implementations of both the technique and the <code>picture</code> element that's the new proposed standard. Are they production ready? Maybe not, but they can get us started in the right direction.
		</p>
  	  </article>

  	  <article>
  	  	<h2>So in summation...</h2>
	  </article>

	  <article>
	  	<h3>Responsive Web Design is...</h3>
	  	<p>
	  		A bit more than CSS Media Queries. It's a way of developing an application so that <em>everyone</em> can use it, regardless of device or browser, with functionality that gradually enhances from a baseline experience to a full-fledged experience on devices and browsers that can handle it.
  		</p>
  		<p>
  			Moreover, it allows us to abstract away device and browser and think instead of the site experience in terms of availability (of screen) and capability (of platform).
